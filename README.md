## Overview

This includes scripts to help with maintenance of [Spotlight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight) exhibits app.

It includes scripts for:
* managing data integrity
* working with data in [Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)

The scripts and how to use them are documented in the [Wiki](https://github.com/elrayle/spotlight_utils/wiki) for this repository.

All scripts are provided in hopes that they will help you in your development process.  They will become dated overtime and I do not guarantee I will update them as version changes occur.  For that reason, developers are cautioned to verify that the scripts will work with your version of Spotlight and in a way that you expect.  They are offered without warranty.
